# np

Simple utility for creating new projects in Sbt

Steps it took to get this project started

    $ touch build.sbt
    $ mkdir -p src/{main,test}/scala
    $ e build.sbt # fill in the basics (name, organization, version)
    $ touch README.md && e README.md
    $ sbt
    # start coding

Desired steps to take to start this project

    $ sbt
    $ np name:np
    # start coding

^ No context switching ^.

Already have a project and want a sub project? No problem.

    $ sbt
    $ np name:my-sub-project dir:sub-project-dir

This will create a new sbt project source tree for a project named my-sub-project under
the directory named sub-project-dir relative you your projects base directory. From your main build configuration you can use this as a stub and reference it as.

    lazy val sub = Project("my-sub-project", file("sub-project-dir"))

Or remove the generated stub `build.sbt` and just use the generate source tree

## Requirements

- Simple Build Tool
- The buring desire to start your projects quickly

## Installation

In most cases a global installation will make the most sense as the target usage for this plugin is the creation of new projects


### for sbt 0.12 of lower

For global installation, if you have a `~/.sbt` directory created, in a `~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt` file add the following

For local installation, if you have a `~/project` directory created, in a `~/project/build.sbt` file add the following

    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "np" % "0.2.0")

    resolvers += Resolver.url("sbt-plugin-releases",
      url("http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-plugin-releases/"))(
        Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)

Or if you prefer, you can call depend on the project reference as a `git` repository.

    import sbt._

    object Plugins extends Build {
      lazy val root = Project("root", file(".")) dependsOn(
        uri("git://github.com/softprops/np.git#0.2.0")
      )
    }

Be sure to _explicitly_ mix np's settings into your build definition.

    seq(npSettings: _*)

Doing this in a global `.sbt` file under `~/.sbt` (e.g. ~/.sbt/np.sbt) will make `np`'s setting available to all of your sbt projects.

### for sbt 0.13+

If you don't already have one, create an `~/.sbt/0.13/plugins` directory. And inside of it, create an `np.sbt` ( it doesn't matter what you call it ) file containing the line

    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "np" % "0.2.0")
    
This will make `npSettings` globally visible to your project definitions.

If you wish to globally mix in `npSettings`, create a file under `~/.sbt/0.13` called `np.sbt` ( it doesn't matter what you call this either ) containing the line

    seq(npSettings: _*)

### Customization

If you have a lot of projects that use the same ivy organization id (your own) or you always start projects with the same version conventions (a SNAPSHOT), you may want to define your own custom global overrides.

To do so, in a `~/.sbt/np.sbt` file in sbt 0.12, or `~/.sbt/0.13/np.sbt` file in 0.13, add the following.

    seq(npSettings:_*)

    (NpKeys.defaults in (Compile, NpKeys.np)) ~= {
      _.copy(org="me.lessis", version="0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
    }

See the `np` option reference section below for all available options

## Settings

    np               # generates a new project given a set of options
    scout(for np)    # detects potential conflicts with generating a project, recommended before np
    usage(for np)    # displays usage options
    defaults(for np) # default values for options

In sbt 0.13 you can resolve the scoped settings using `::`

    np::scout
    np::usage
    np::defaults

### np option reference

`np` generates sbt projects given `key:value` options. Below is a list of current options

    org     Project organization. Defaults to defaults key sbt built-in default
    name    Project name. Defaults to defaults key or sbt built-in default
    version Project version. Defaults to defaults key or sbt built-in default
    plugin  Boolean indicator of whether the project is a plugin project. Defaults to defaults key or false
    dir     Path to dir where np should generate project. Defaults to defaults key or '.'
